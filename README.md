This is a simple, python3-based UI front end for the Proxmark 3 client to allow a user to read, write, or erase a LF T5577 card in the EM410x format. Useful for a CTF challenge where we don't expect/want the players to use the full PM3 client. 

Dependencies:
- Python 3
- GuiZero 1.4 or later (sudo apt-get -y install python3-guizero)
- [Proxmark 3 client](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3) installed and in the system path (See [install instructions](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3?tab=readme-ov-file#proxmark3-installation-and-overview))
